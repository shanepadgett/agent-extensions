# Tasks

Create implementation tasks for the change set. This command is for **full lane** only.

> **Note**: Vibe and bug lanes skip this command. They use `/sdd/plan` which combines research, tasking, and planning into a single `plan.md` file.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - Change set name

## Instructions

### Setup

1. Read `changes/<name>/state.md` - verify phase is `tasks` and lane is `full`
2. Read delta specs from `changes/<name>/specs/`
3. Read `changes/<name>/proposal.md` to understand high-level intent and goals
4. Read any architectural thoughts in `changes/<name>/thoughts/`

If lane is `vibe` or `bug`, redirect user to `/sdd/plan` instead.

### Task Structure

Create `changes/<name>/tasks.md` using checkbox-style progress tracking:
- `[ ]` = Pending
- `[o]` = In Progress (exactly one task at a time)
- `[x]` = Complete

```markdown
# Tasks: <name>

## Overview

Brief summary of what these tasks accomplish.

## Tasks

### 1. [ ] <Title>

**Description:**
What this task accomplishes. Focus on why it exists and what it changes.

**Requirements:**

#### <spec-path>
- "<full EARS requirement line>"

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- <Testable criterion>
- <Testable criterion>

### Task Ordering & Logic

Design tasks to ensure the application is **never in a broken state** and can be **committed after every task**.

1. **Foundations First**: Models, types, interfaces, and database migrations.
2. **Implementation Slices**: Implement functionality in vertical slices that introduce new code paths behind flags or as new modules before wiring them in.
3. **Integration**: Connect new components to existing systems.
4. **Validation**: Test suites, cleanup of old paths, and consolidation.

Order tasks by dependency. A task is only "done" when the system is stable and committable.

### Task Granularity

Each task should be:
- Completable in one implementation session
- Independently testable
- Clear on what "done" means

### Requirement Mapping

- Every requirement in delta specs must map to at least one task
- Tasks MUST reference requirements by quoting the full EARS line and specifying the source spec file
- Use `spec-format` skill to understand requirement structure

### Completion

Work through task breakdown collaboratively with the user. When they explicitly approve:

1. Log approval in state.md under `## Pending`:
   ```
   None - Tasks approved: [number] tasks defined
   ```
2. Update state.md phase to `plan`
3. Suggest running `/sdd/plan <name>` to plan first task

Don't advance until the user clearly signals approval. Questions, feedback, or acknowledgments don't count as approval.
