# Implement

Execute the current implementation plan.

> **SDD Process**: Read `changes/<name>/state.md` first to verify phase is `implement`. If unsure how state management works, read `.augment/skills/sdd-state-management.md` (project-local) or `~/.augment/skills/sdd-state-management.md` (global).

> **Research**: If you encounter unexpected code during implementation, delegate to `@librarian` with a specific question. See `.augment/skills/research.md` (project-local) or `~/.augment/skills/research.md` (global) for guidance.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - Change set name

## Instructions

### Setup

1. Read `changes/<name>/state.md` - verify phase is `implement`
2. Determine lane and load plan:
   - **Full lane**: Read `changes/<name>/tasks.md` only to identify the current task (prefer `[o]`; otherwise first `[ ]`). Then load the corresponding plan from `changes/<name>/plans/`.
   - **Vibe/Bug lane**: Read `changes/<name>/plan.md` (single combined plan)

For full lane, the plan file is the source of truth for what to do; `tasks.md` is bookkeeping (current task + completion).

### Implementation Process

Execute the plan step by step:

1. **Follow the plan**: The plan was created for a reason - follow it
2. **Validate as you go**: Run tests/checks after each significant change
3. **Keep the repo green**: Don't leave broken state
4. **Document deviations**: If you must deviate from plan, note why

### Research During Implementation

If you encounter unexpected situations, delegate to `@librarian`:

- **Unexpected code structure**: Investigate to understand it
- **Need to understand a dependency**: Research how it works
- **Unclear integration**: Research before guessing

Don't guess when you can research. But also don't over-research - the plan should have captured the major research needs.

### Handling Issues

If implementation reveals plan problems:

- **Minor adjustments**: Proceed, document deviation in plan
- **Major issues**: Stop, discuss with user, potentially re-plan
- **Spec issues (full lane)**: Flag for reconciliation (don't modify specs during implement)

### Validation

After implementation:

1. Run validation steps from plan
2. Verify acceptance criteria are met
3. Ensure tests pass

### Completion

**Full Lane:**
1. Review results with the user and confirm validation is green.
2. When the user explicitly approves the implementation, suggest making a git commit before advancing state. Provide a copy/paste commit message:
   - `git commit -am "<concise message summarizing what/why>"`
3. Wait for the user to confirm the commit is made and the working tree is clean.
4. Update `changes/<name>/tasks.md`: change the current `[o]` to `[x]`.
5. If any tasks remain `[ ]` after marking the current task complete, update `changes/<name>/state.md` phase to `plan` and suggest `/sdd:plan <name>`.
6. If no tasks remain `[ ]` (i.e., you just completed the last task in the change set), update `changes/<name>/state.md` phase to `reconcile` and suggest `/sdd:reconcile <name>`.

Do not log completion in `## Pending` (that section is for unresolved blockers/decisions only). If a completion/approval record is needed, capture it in a separate artifact (e.g., `changes/<name>/thoughts/decisions.md`).

**Vibe/Bug Lane:**
1. Implementation complete - discuss with user what's next:
   - **Throwing away**: Done - no state update needed
   - **Keeping the work**: When user decides to keep it, update state to `reconcile`, suggest `/sdd:reconcile <name>`

Don't advance until the user clearly signals approval. Questions, feedback, or acknowledgments don't count as approval.

> **Note**: For vibe/bug lanes, reconcile is optional. If the work is exploratory or a quick fix that doesn't warrant spec updates, stopping here is perfectly valid.
