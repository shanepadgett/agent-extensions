# SDD Vibe

## Required Skills

- `sdd-state-management`

## Inputs

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must ask the user for the following information; do not assume CLI arguments are provided.

- **Exploration Context**: Ask the user what they want to prototype, explore, or experiment with.
- **Change Set Name**: Ask the user for a name to track this experiment (e.g., `vibe-new-ui-hook`).

## Instructions

Vibe lane is your partner for getting through SDD without the ceremony. Think collaborative vibe coding: throw ideas, prototype freely, create documents as insights emerge, let good ones stick. Goal: sane software, not perfect specs. Work together to explore, iterate, shape loose thoughts into actionable plans—run validations so vibes become good vibes.

1. **Resolution**: Check existing change sets. If one exists, proceed. If multiple, ask whether new or continuing. When continuing, inspect `state.md`, `context.md`, and pending items. Ask where to resume if jump point unclear.
2. **Initialize**: Create `changes/<name>/` with `state.md` (lane: vibe, phase: plan, status: in_progress) and `context.md` (intent, initial thoughts, curiosity).
3. **Explore Together**: Dive in. Prototype freely, create documents when insights emerge, capture thoughts. Collaboratively refine into at least a light proposal leading to research and planning. No wrong turn if you document learning.
4. **Keep Context Alive**: Continuously update `state.md` with pending items, decisions, next steps. Update `context.md` as intent evolves. Captures progress for seamless continuation—never lose the thread.
5. **Deliver Sanity, Not Ceremony**: Build plans, run validations. Ensure exploration converges on sane software. Inform user specifications captured during `reconcile` if kept—until then, focus on vibe, not paperwork.

## Success Criteria

- Change set initialized with `vibe` lane and collaborative context captured.
- User flows through exploration, creating documents and artifacts as insights emerge.
- Session maintains continuous state updates—pending items, decisions, next steps—for seamless continuation.
- Exploration converges on actionable results: light proposal, research, and planning that leads to sane implementation.

## Usage Examples

### Do: Embrace the vibe

"What's on your mind? I'll fire up vibe lane `vibe-api-redesign` and we can prototype endpoints, document what works, and shape it into something solid—all without getting bogged down in specs."

### Don't: Use vibe to skip necessary rigor

Avoid vibe lane for major features where architectural alignment impacts production readiness. Suggest full lane instead when the scope demands structured specification.
