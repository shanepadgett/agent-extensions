# Required Skills (Must Load)

You MUST load and follow these skills before doing anything else:

- `sdd-state-management`
- `spec-format`

If any required skill content is missing or not available in context, you MUST stop and ask the user to re-run the command or otherwise provide the missing skill content. Do NOT proceed without them.

# Tasks

Create implementation tasks for the change set. This command is for **full lane** only.

> **Note**: Vibe and bug lanes skip this command. They use `/sdd/plan` which combines research, tasking, and planning into a single `plan.md` file.

## Inputs

- Change set name (ask the user if missing)

## Instructions

### Setup

Run:
- `cat changes/<change-set-name>/state.md 2>/dev/null || echo "State file not found"`
- `cat changes/<change-set-name>/proposal.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No proposal found"`
- `find changes/<change-set-name>/specs -name "*.md" -exec cat {} + 2>/dev/null || echo "No specs found"`
- `find changes/<change-set-name>/thoughts -name "*.md" -exec cat {} + 2>/dev/null || echo "No thoughts found"`

### Entry Check

Apply state entry check logic from `sdd-state-management` skill.

If lane is `vibe` or `bug`, redirect user to `/sdd/plan` instead.

> **Note**: The proposal, specs, and thoughts are injected above. Do NOT manually read these files—they are already in your context.

### Collaborative Tasking

This command is a **dialogue**, not a one-way generation.

1. **Think Out Loud**: Before writing the file, present your initial thoughts on the task breakdown.
   - Generalize the requirements: Tasks should include *anything* necessary to make the implementation successful (e.g., scaffolding, environment setup, refactoring).
   - Traceability: You MUST explicitly call out which specific spec requirements are covered by each task.
   - Explain *why* you're grouping certain requirements and why you've chosen a specific order (e.g., maintaining system stability, foundation-first).
2. **Present Options**: If there are multiple valid ways to slice the work (e.g., horizontal vs vertical, foundation-first vs feature-first), present them to the user with trade-offs.
3. **Invite Feedback**: Explicitly ask the user if they have specific preferences for task granularity or if there's a specific logical flow they want to follow to maintain system stability.
4. **Iterate**: Only write `tasks.md` once a consensus on the strategy has been reached.

Update state.md `## Notes` with task breakdown decisions and rationale.

### Task Structure

Create `changes/<name>/tasks.md` using checkbox-style progress tracking:
- `[ ]` = Pending
- `[o]` = In Progress (exactly one task at a time)
- `[x]` = Complete

```markdown
# Tasks: <name>

## Overview

Brief summary of what these tasks accomplish.

## Tasks

### [ ] <Title>

**Description:**
What this task accomplishes. Focus on why it exists and what it changes.

**Requirements:**

#### Foundations & Prerequisites (if any, else skip)
- <Description of technical prerequisite, scaffolding, or environment setup needed for success>

#### <spec-path>
- "<full EARS requirement line>"
...
```

### Task Ordering & Logic

Design tasks to ensure the application is **never in a broken state** and can be **committed after every task**.

1. **Foundations First**: Models, types, interfaces, and database migrations.
2. **Implementation Slices**: Implement functionality in vertical slices that introduce new code paths behind flags or as new modules before wiring them in.
3. **Integration**: Connect new components to existing systems.
4. **Validation**: Test suites, cleanup of old paths, and consolidation.

Order tasks by dependency. A task is only "done" when the system is stable and committable.

### Task Granularity

Each task should be:
- Completable in one implementation session
- Independently testable
- Clear on what "done" means

### Requirement Mapping

- Every requirement in change-set specs must map to at least one task
- Tasks MUST reference requirements by quoting the full EARS line and specifying the source spec file
- Use `spec-format` skill to understand requirement structure

### Completion

When they explicitly approve the tasks:

1. Update state.md: `## Phase Status: complete`, clear `## Notes`
2. Suggest running `/sdd/plan <name>` to plan first task

Do not log completion in `## Pending` (that section is for unresolved blockers/decisions only).
