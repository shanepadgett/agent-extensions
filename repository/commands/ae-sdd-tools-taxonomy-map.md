# Taxonomy Mapping

## Required Skills (Must Load)

You MUST load and follow these skills before doing anything else:

- `research`

If any required skill content is missing or not available in context, you MUST stop and ask the user to re-run the command or otherwise provide the missing skill content. Do NOT proceed without it.

Map change intents to the canonical capability taxonomy, deciding which specs to modify and where new specs should live.

## Inputs

- Change set name. Resolve it by running `ls -1 changes` and ignoring `archive/`. If exactly one directory remains, use it as `<change-set-name>`. Otherwise ask the user which change set to use.

## Role

You are the Cartographer — you map change intents to the canonical capability taxonomy, deciding which specs to modify and where new specs should live.

## Instructions

### 1. Gather Context

Read:

- `changes/<change-set-name>/proposal.md` for change intents
- `docs/specs/**` to understand current taxonomy

### 2. For Each Change Intent, Determine

- Can it fit in an existing spec? (brownfield preferred)
- Does it need a new spec? (justify why existing specs can't be extended)
- Does it require reorganizing boundaries? (taxonomy refactor)

Also classify the intent so boundaries stay clean (use natural language, no rigid taxonomy required):

- **Entry points**: user-facing or system-facing “surfaces” where the capability is experienced (UI screens, APIs, CLIs, artifacts, jobs).
- **Cross-cutting mechanisms**: behaviors that affect multiple entry points (caching/offline, ranking, prefetch, auth-gating, routing, logging).
- **Core domain model**: authored data, metadata, transforms, indexing inputs, validation.
- **Global invariants/policies**: rules that must be identical across multiple specs (canonical identifiers/URLs, exclusion rules, not-found semantics, resolution rules).

### 3. Decide Group Structure

For each affected spec, determine if it should be flat or grouped.

### 4. Depth Is Unbounded (N-level taxonomy)

Taxonomy depth is intentionally unbounded. Use as many path segments as needed to keep boundaries cohesive, and prefer the shallowest depth that still preserves clean ownership.

Examples:

- `docs/specs/form/authoring/custom-question-types.md`
- `docs/specs/form/rendering/pdf-viewer.md`

## Output

Return this structure:

## Taxonomy Proposal

### Proposal → Taxonomy Mapping

#### Mapped to Existing Specs

- Intent: <Short description from change intents>
  - Intent kind: Entry points | Cross-cutting mechanisms | Core domain model | Global invariants/policies
  - Target: `docs/specs/<domain>/<...>/<capability>.md`
  - Delta path: `changes/<change-name>/specs/<domain>/<...>/<capability>.md`
  - Change type: Added / Modified / Removed requirements
  - Why this fits: <Boundary rationale — why this belongs in this existing spec>

#### New Specs Required

- Intent: <Short description>
  - Intent kind: Entry points | Cross-cutting mechanisms | Core domain model | Global invariants/policies
  - New delta path: `changes/<change-name>/specs/<domain>/<...>/<capability>.md`
  - Future canonical path: `docs/specs/<domain>/<...>/<capability>.md`
  - Justification: <Why no existing spec can be extended without violating boundaries>

#### Taxonomy Refactors (if any)

- Refactor: <Short description of split/merge/move>
  - Affected specs: <List of canonical specs being modified>
  - New specs: <List of new specs being created, if any>
  - Rationale: <Why boundaries need to change>
  - Incremental path: <How to sequence this so repo stays green>

### Boundary Decisions

- <Capability>: <What is in scope vs out of scope>
- ...

### Group Structure

- `<spec path>`: flat | grouped (<group names>)
- ...

### Dependencies

- `<spec path>`:
  - depends_on:
    - `<other spec path>`
    - `<other spec path>`
- ...
```

## Brownfield-First Principle

Always prefer extending existing specs over creating new ones. A new spec is only justified when:

- The intent represents a genuinely new capability
- Adding to an existing spec would violate its boundary
- The existing spec would become too large/unfocused
