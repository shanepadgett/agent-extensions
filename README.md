  <strong>Supercharge your AI coding agents with curated commands, skills, and hooks.</strong>

## Philosophy

Agent Extensions embraces spec-driven development, where specifications are treated as first-class citizens alongside code. Think of specs as source code and your implementation as the compiled binary. Well-curated specs capture intent, constraints, and long-term vision, while the code is simply their executable form.

These extensions are not about completing a single ticket. They are about building products with intention, where every feature traces back to a specification that explains the *why*, not just the *how*. Your AI agents become partners in maintaining this discipline, helping you plan, discover, implement, and reconcile against specs throughout the entire development lifecycle.
