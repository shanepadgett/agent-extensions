# Required Skills (Must Load)

You MUST load and follow these skills before doing anything else:

- `sdd-state-management`
- `research`

If any required skill content is missing or not available in context, you MUST stop and ask the user to re-run the command or otherwise provide the missing skill content. Do NOT proceed without them.

# Proposal

Draft and refine the proposal document for a change set. This command is primarily for **full lane** work.

> **Note**: Vibe lane uses `/sdd/fast/vibe` which creates a lightweight `context.md` instead of a formal proposal. Bug lane uses `/sdd/fast/bug` which handles triage and context creation.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - Change set name

## Instructions

### Setup

Run:
- `cat changes/$1/state.md 2>/dev/null || echo "State file not found"`
- `cat changes/$1/seed.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No seed found"`
- `cat changes/$1/proposal.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No proposal found"`

### Entry Check

Apply state entry check logic from `sdd-state-management` skill.

### Research Phase (Recommended)

For non-trivial proposals, use the `research` skill:

1. **Investigate the codebase** to understand:
   - Does similar functionality already exist?
   - What would this change interact with?
   - Are there existing patterns or constraints to respect?

2. **Inform the proposal** with findings:
   - Reference existing code/patterns in approach
   - Note integration points
   - Identify potential risks based on codebase structure

### Lane Selection

If lane not yet selected, determine with user:

| Lane | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `full` | New capabilities, architectural changes, complex features |
| `vibe` | Prototypes, experiments, quick enhancements (use `/sdd/fast/vibe` instead) |
| `bug` | Fixing incorrect behavior (use `/sdd/fast/bug` instead) |

For vibe or bug work, redirect user to the appropriate fast command.

Update state.md `## Lane` with selected lane.

### Collaborative Refinement

This is a dialogue, not a generation task. The user brings whatever definition they have—a half-formed idea, a detailed vision, a conversation summary—and you help them refine it into something complete enough for specs.

**The user is the domain expert.** They have tribal knowledge about users, business context, past decisions, and constraints that isn't written anywhere. Your job is to help them externalize and articulate it, not to invent it.

**Ask, don't assume.** When there's a gap, surface it as a question: "What happens if the upload fails mid-stream?" Don't fill gaps with guesses.

**Recommend, don't decide.** If you see a pattern in the codebase that might apply: "Based on how similar features work, you might want to handle this as X—does that fit?" Let the user decide.

**Surface logic gaps.** When the described behavior has holes: "You mentioned auto-save, but what happens if the user is offline? Is that something we need to handle?" Ask if it should be considered, then let them answer.

Update state.md `## Notes` with key decisions and progress during this phase.

### Proposal Content

A proposal describes **how the system works**—written so anyone could read it and understand the feature.

**Start with the problem.** One or two sentences on what pain exists today. This anchors everything that follows.

**Cover the full behavior.** Write in narrative prose. Be specific and concrete.

- What does the user do? What happens in response?
- What does the system do automatically? When and why?
- What happens when things go wrong? How does the system recover or report?
- If there are different modes or states, how do they differ?

**Leave nothing implied.** If there's behavior the user is picturing but hasn't written down, it won't make it to specs. The proposal is the complete source of truth for what gets built.

**Stay affirmative.** Describe what the system does, not what it doesn't do. Scope exclusions, future considerations, and hedged commitments ("if time permits...") dilute focus and create noise for the specs phase. If you need to track these, put them in `boundaries.md` or `future.md`—not in the proposal.

### Structure Sensing

As the user describes the feature, notice when natural boundaries emerge:

**Capability boundaries.** "It sounds like there are two distinct capabilities here: the edit flow itself, and the validation that happens before saving. Am I reading that right?"

**Domain awareness.** "So this would live under notifications, or is it more of a user-preferences thing?" Ask rather than decide—help the user identify where this belongs.

Don't force structure prematurely. The goal is to surface what's emerging and check if your framing matches the user's mental model. This makes the specs phase easier without imposing a taxonomy.

### Readiness

A proposal is ready for specs when you can answer "how does the system handle..." for any scenario using only what's written.

### Critique (Recommended)

For full lane proposals, suggest the user run `/sdd/tools/critique` for analytical critique:

- Identifies contradictions, gaps, and risks
- Challenges unstated assumptions
- Provides honest assessment of proposal quality

Address any serious issues raised before proceeding.

### Scenario Testing (Recommended)

After critique, suggest the user run `/sdd/tools/scenario-test` for user-perspective validation:

- Tests proposal by inhabiting a realistic user persona
- Identifies gaps, friction points, and ambiguities
- Reports whether a user could actually accomplish their goals

Address blocking issues before proceeding; note friction points for consideration.

### Completion

When they explicitly approve the proposal:

1. Update state.md: `## Phase Status: complete`, clear `## Notes`
2. Suggest `/sdd/specs <name>` to write change-set specifications (`kind: new|delta`)

Do not log completion in `## Pending` (that section is for unresolved blockers/decisions only).
